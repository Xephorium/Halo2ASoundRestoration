Before the audio restoration script was updated to modify tag files,
a few manual changes were needed after automatic replacement was
complete. This process should no longer be necessary. But just in
case, I've retained my guide on the process and many of the changes
themselves here:


1. Open Guerilla with the correct tag directory set.

    Via Command Line:
        start guerilla -tags_dir "<H2EK installation directory>\tags"

2. Navigate to each tag below in the panel on the left. Double click to open and set
   the specified values for each tag. Either ctrl+s or click yes on the save dialog
   before closing each tag.
