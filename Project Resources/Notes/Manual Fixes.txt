After running the audio restoration script, the following tags will need to
have their audible distance and volume adjusted manually. This is cumbersome,
but a far cry better than manually updating all 800 tags, *then* making these
adjustments. To make the changes, complete the following steps:


1. Open Guerilla with the correct tag directory set.

    Via Command Line:
        start guerilla -tags_dir "<H2EK installation directory>\tags"

2. Navigate to each tag below in the panel on the left. Double click to open and set
   the specified values for each tag. Either ctrl+s or click yes on the save dialog
   before closing each tag.
