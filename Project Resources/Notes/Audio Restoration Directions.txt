/// Overview

    Upon each new release of the Master Chief Collection, I'll need to generate a new
    version of this mod with restored anniversary campaign audio. To save myself a little
    headache each time, the entire process is outlined below.


/// Directions

    1. Extract fresh vanilla tags.

        a. Update Halo 2 Mod Tools in Steam.

        b. Navigate to '<steam games>\steamapps\common\H2EK'. Delete the 'tags' and 'tags_bak' folders.

        c. Double click 'H2EK (Extract).bat' to extract the new tags to the 'tags' folder.

        d. Copy 'tags' to a new folder called 'tags_bak'. (This allows us to quickly reset the tags if something breaks while running the restoration script.)

    2. Restore classic audio to Anniversary campaign.

        a. Command Line - Run 'H2AResetTags' to ensure all files in 'tags' folder match 'tags_bak' folder.

        b. IntelliJ - Open 'Halo 2A Sound Restoration' project. Execute 'run.bat' or click 'Run Project' (upper right) to begin restoration.

        c. Check output report for any issues. If no problems, proceed to build maps.

    3. Build new map files.

        a. Command Line - Run 'H2ABuildMaps'. This will take ~15mins to build new map files in '<steam games>\steamapps\common\H2EK\h2_maps_win64_dx11'.

        b. Backup vanilla campaign map files in '<steam games>\steamapps\common\Halo The Master Chief Collection\halo2\h2_maps_win64_dx11'.

        c. Copy generated map files to the above MCC directory, replacing all.

        d. The H2A campaign is now updated locally and ready to play in MCC!
